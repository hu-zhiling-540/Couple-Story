# Morphing-Society

## Statement
We use shapes to represent different states of life, especially focusing on two individuals who can establish, and break up a relationship between each other.

As individuals, we have distinctive personality. We are born with edges. That’s why we see a person with initial state as a square. But as new people come into our lives, most of us will rub down the edges to have a well-rounded character to fit in, like a circle. And when two people come closer, they get the chance to know each other, and approach closer when they want to stay together. They are not separated any more, and will be incomplete without the partner. So it’s a combined heart shape. 

But things also change. If two people get further away from each other, their relationship comes to an end. The break up, and return what they have been before. Their traces of life towards meeting ex will be displayed, as they’ve been through an important part of self-recognition. Until they find another person to engaged in a new relationship. It’s another couple’s story.
